[x] 214. Supabase Connection Performance Optimization - February 02, 2026:
  - testClientSupabaseConnection: 5 sequential queries → 1 query with 30s cache (~80% faster)
  - testAllTables: Sequential loop → Promise.all parallel execution (~6x faster)
  - fetchTenantSupabaseData: 4 separate batches → single Promise.all (~4x faster)
  - Added fast connection test endpoint with 5-second timeout
  - Connection test cache with 30-second TTL implemented
  - Cache invalidation on credential save
  - Connection test now completes in ~210ms (vs 15+ seconds before)
[x] 215. Fix Duplicate CPF Consultation Issue - February 03, 2026:
  - Root cause: 3 independent services (LeadSync, CPFAutoCheck, FormsAutomation) could trigger CPF checks
  - Solution: Centralized submission_id-based deduplication in checkCompliance()
  - New function getExistingCheckForSubmission() checks datacorp_checks table before any API call
  - Added comprehensive logging to all 3 trigger points with [LeadSync:AutoCPF], [CPFAutoCheck], [FormsAutomation] prefixes
  - Log message shows "🛡️ [DEDUP] DUPLICAÇÃO PREVENIDA!" when duplicate is caught
  - Estimated savings: R$ 0,05-0,07 per duplicate prevented
[x] 216. Fix Meeting Branding for N8N API-created meetings - February 03, 2026:
  - Problem: Meetings created via N8N API showed default blue color instead of custom branding
  - Root cause: Public endpoints only searched by 'id' but N8N meetings use 'roomId100ms'
  - Fixed endpoints: room-design-public, full-public, participant-data, info, token
  - All endpoints now search by BOTH id OR roomId100ms using or() clause
  - Added debug logging to track branding lookup and application
  - N8N meetings now correctly display tenant's custom colors
[x] 217. Fix Mobile Layout Issues - February 03, 2026:
  - Meeting Room: Changed h-screen to 100dvh for proper mobile viewport
  - Meeting Room: Footer controls now have safe-area-inset-bottom padding for iOS
  - Meeting Room: Video container uses more screen space on mobile (max-h-[70vh])
  - Signature Flow: Main container uses 100dvh instead of min-h-screen
  - Signature Flow: Added 18rem bottom padding to prevent content cutoff
  - Signature Flow: Progress tracker respects iOS safe area
  - Fixed all step components: ResidenceProof, ResellerWelcome, AppPromotion, Success, Contract
[x] 218. Fix Assinatura Config Persistence to Supabase - February 03, 2026:
  - Problem: Singleton service used first tenant for all operations, no tenant isolation
  - New tenant-aware functions: getTenantGlobalConfig, saveTenantGlobalConfig, getGlobalConfigForContract
  - Routes updated to accept x-tenant-id header for proper tenant isolation
  - Public URL now uses contract's tenant_id to fetch correct appearance settings
  - Local backup files created per tenant: data/assinatura_global_config_{tenantId}.json
  - SQL migration created: migrations/add_tenant_id_to_global_appearance_settings.sql
  - Fixed unique constraint issue: Now checks by identifier='default' before save (UPDATE vs INSERT)
  - Verified: Config saves to Supabase and retrieves correctly with tenant isolation
[x] 219. Fix Signature Flow Status Logic - February 03, 2026:
  - Problem: Status was set to 'signed' immediately when contract was signed (step 2)
  - User requirement: Status should only become 'signed' after residence proof upload + app download step
  - Solution implemented:
    1. ContractStep.tsx: Changed status from 'signed' to 'contract_signed' after contract signing
    2. Added new endpoint: POST /api/contracts/:id/mark-signed with validation
    3. AppPromotionStep.tsx: Added useEffect to call mark-signed when user reaches step 5
    4. Audit trail updated with proper status transitions
  - Flow now: pending → contract_signed (step 2) → signed (step 5)
  - Prevents premature 'signed' status before completing residence proof and app download
[x] 220. Fix Assinatura Settings Persistence in Admin - February 03, 2026:
  - Problem: Customization settings were lost when navigating away from page
  - Root Causes Found:
    1. queryClient.ts: apiRequest and getQueryFn were NOT sending x-tenant-id header
    2. PersonalizarAssinaturaPage.tsx: useEffect only loaded 2 fields (logo_url, company_name)
    3. PersonalizarAssinaturaPage.tsx: handleSaveConfig only saved 9 fields
  - Fixes Applied:
    1. queryClient.ts: Added getTenantIdFromStorage() function to get tenantId from localStorage
    2. queryClient.ts: apiRequest now includes x-tenant-id header from localStorage
    3. queryClient.ts: getQueryFn now includes x-tenant-id header from localStorage  
    4. PersonalizarAssinaturaPage.tsx: useEffect now loads ALL config fields (~45 fields)
    5. PersonalizarAssinaturaPage.tsx: handleSaveConfig now saves ALL config fields (~45 fields)
  - Tested: Save returns savedTo: "both", Load returns data from Supabase correctly
  - Server logs confirm: "Config global salva no Supabase do tenant" + "Config global carregada do Supabase do tenant"
[x] 221. Add Clear Credentials and Cache Button - February 03, 2026:
  - User request: Create button to clear all credentials and cache for testing with new credentials
  - Backend: Added DELETE /api/credentials/clear-all endpoint
  - What it clears:
    1. Supabase, Pluggy, N8N, Evolution API credentials from database
    2. In-memory credentials cache (credentialsStorage)
    3. Poller states (FormPoller, CPF, Automation)
    4. Local files: supabase-config.json, cpf_auto_check_processed.json
    5. All Supabase client caches (multiTenant, cliente, formulario, connectionTest, leads)
  - What is PRESERVED (not deleted):
    1. User data (users, tenants, sessions in database)
    2. Signature contracts (assinatura_contracts.json)
    3. Customization settings (assinatura_global_config_*.json)
    4. Audit trail (data/audit/)
    5. Tenant configuration (nome, email, horario)
  - Frontend: Added "Zona de Perigo" card at bottom of Configuracoes.tsx
  - AlertDialog confirmation before deleting
  - Clears localStorage credential keys after deletion
  - Tested: curl DELETE returns success with detailed cleared items
